Yes, it's possible to implement a CLI application using a microservices architecture, although it may seem unconventional for a CLI application since microservices are more commonly associated with distributed systems and web-based applications. However, if your CLI application is part of a larger ecosystem or if you anticipate the need for scalability, flexibility, or independent deployment of different components, then adopting a microservices architecture might be beneficial.

Here's how you could structure a CLI application with a microservices architecture:

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI) Module:**
   - This module would handle user interactions, display menus, and capture user input from the command line.
   - It acts as the entry point for the application and interacts with the various microservices.

2. **Microservices:**
   - Each microservice would encapsulate a specific functionality or domain within the application.
   - Examples of microservices for a todo application could include user management, todo item management, authentication, notification, etc.

3. **Communication between CLI and Microservices:**
   - The CLI module communicates with the microservices over the network, typically using HTTP REST APIs or messaging protocols like MQTT.
   - Each microservice exposes endpoints or message queues for interaction.

4. **Decentralized Data Storage:**
   - Each microservice may have its own database or data store, optimized for its specific requirements.
   - Alternatively, you could use a shared database but ensure data isolation between microservices.

5. **Containerization and Orchestration:**
   - Microservices are often containerized using technologies like Docker and orchestrated using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for deployment, scaling, and management.

6. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:**
   - Service discovery mechanisms help the CLI module locate and communicate with the appropriate microservices.
   - Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of microservices to ensure scalability and high availability.

While implementing a CLI application with a microservices architecture introduces additional complexity compared to a monolithic approach, it offers benefits like scalability, fault isolation, and easier maintenance and deployment of individual components. However, it's essential to carefully consider the trade-offs and whether the benefits outweigh the added complexity for your specific use case.
